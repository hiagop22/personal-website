        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
            My background in Mechatronic Engineering from the University of Brasília (UnB) laid the foundation for a career driven by automation, systems thinking, and efficiency. Early on, I combined my passion for software with real-world engineering challenges, contributing to autonomous robotics research and serving as a Teaching Assistant in programming and mathematics courses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I specialize in DevOps engineering, focusing on cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), observability, and container orchestration. I've worked across AWS and Azure environments using tools like Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins to automate and scale software delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
            My professional experience includes provisioning and managing cloud-native architectures, securing systems with best DevSecOps practices, and building pipelines that enable agile teams to deploy applications and ML models reliably. I'm certified in AWS and Azure, and always looking for ways to improve system reliability and developer velocity.
        </p>
        <p>
            While my focus has shifted toward backend and infrastructure, I continue to explore adjacent technologies—including container security, service meshes, and monitoring stacks—to stay sharp in a rapidly evolving DevOps landscape.
